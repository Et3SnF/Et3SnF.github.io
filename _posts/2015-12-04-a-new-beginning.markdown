## About me and why...

Hello. I see that you clicked here out of curiosity...or not.  A little about me -  I was an organic chemist at some point where I made monomers and polymers for certain solar cells in its infancy. At the time I thought this was what I wanted to do until I realized something was wrong. Without going into too much detail, I decided to move on. 

Before I left, I thought what I was going to do next - programming. Well why? Here are a few reasons with explanations as to why I decided to choose programming as a next part of my life:

1. **I love anything that is logical, puzzle related, and overall mathematics.** (*"Well, why didn't you become some actuary, accountant, some math wiz, or whatever??"* Go to the next one.)

2. **I don't see myself looking at a bunch of numbers all day over and over again.** Why? I will like it at first but eventually I'll get bored and things would feel uneventful. If I still had a choice in my life before I get too old, I would move on. I would still do it over some career such as a sales representative. Programming has something new every day and it keeps me occupied.

3. **I love technology!** Oddly enough, it's actually the only thing I would talk about passionately non-stop. I would go out and talk to my friends about certain technology being released and overall how fascinating of a time we are living in! Sometimes I feel like I annoy them a bit much of it. New phones with certain features? Wait, what? There's a car with autosteer AND it could also learn?

4. **It was intended to be my hobby in the future.** I've simply never gotten around to getting to it because I was simply too busy doing school and research work at the time. I didn't have time before it because well, I would study all the time. So I've really never had a hobby. But you know, not everything works out in life and pretty much a lot of events in life are unexpected out of one's control. To be honest, I never thought I would actually turning a potential hobby into a potential career. But now that I am in it, I now have some form of understanding to allow myself to fiddle around with things on the weekends.

5. **I wanted to make an application related to smart home.** During my undergraduate years as a completely different major, I asked myself: "Wouldn't it be cool to actually control the thermostat in your home, have the lights turn to certain settings at certain hours, or even have a JARVIS inside your home?" Well, oddly enough there's already things coming out related to smart home technology like Nest and others. It simply does not mean that I will give up and move on to something else. Maybe now that I am in the field already, I should probably build something new on top of it during my spare time. I'll have to see as I want to learn other things related to field as well.

6. **I don't mind sitting there solving logical problems** Some don't mind putting mind the work into a field even though they don't show genuine interest and try not to admit it. For me, I cannot simply do that. If I am not genuinely interested in something, I would not have the drive for it. I would not be able to concentrate and would feel overall dreadful. My mind would simply shut down. Most importantly, when there are situations where I am stumped in a computer science or programming problem, I am absolutely driven to find a solution to it while having some train of though to reach to my conclusion, otherwise I would have given up.

Those are a few points as to why I wanted to do programming after a drastic career change. So far a bit over a year after I quit my job, my adventure to becoming a programmer has been interesting. It's something I never truly expected to happen and it all went by quick. At some point I was in school learning object oriented programming on languages such as C++, Java, and Python. Then suddenly, the next thing is I start a course on learning Android development and learned how to utilize libraries, APIs, and other skills along the way. Now it's the end of 2015. Despite that all of these things happened so quick and that I acquired some development skills, I still have a lot to learn. There is so much to know in this field that it's pretty much a learning experience that will never hit an end in the future. For me, this is just the beginning of the next part of my life. I hope all goes well during this phase.
